PHP PDO Wrapper Class
=====================

> A minimal extension for PHP's PDO class designed to make running SQL statements easier.

### Project Overview

This project provides a minimal extension for PHP's PDO (PHP Data Objects) class designed for ease-of-use and saving development time/effort. This is achieved by providing methods - SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE - for quickly building common SQL statements, handling exceptions when SQL errors are produced, and automatically returning results/number of affected rows for the appropriate SQL statement types.

### System Requirements
- PHP 5
- PDO Extension
- Appropriate PDO Driver(s) - PDO_SQLITE, PDO_MYSQL, PDO_PGSQL
- Only MySQL, SQLite, and PostgreSQL database types are currently supported.

If you think this project is useful and saves you a lot of work, a lot of costs (PHP developers are expensive) and let you sleep much better, then donating a small amount would be very cool.
